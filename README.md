## Death Dealt Hand
<p>is a short playing card game that introduces a twist to the traditional italian card game of Scopa. This is done by infusing horror elements into an otherwise calming experience through fine tunned lighting and post processing effects as well as carefully selected sound effects and ambiance. Inspired by games such as Buckshot Roulette and Inscription, we aimed to create a chilling but memorable game that brings a unique vibe to the playing card table. This game was a collaborative work made in unity by a team of three programmers as a final project.</p>



## Gameplay
<p>Death Dealt Hand's gameplay is simple and mainely revolves around the same mechanics found in a traditional game of Scopa, aside from a couple of small differences. Both the player and the enemy AI will take turns playing a card from their hand until the entire deck has been emptied. From here, points are counted and a new round begins. This will last until either player reaches 11 points, in which case the game will end.</p>
